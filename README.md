# Project Overview

The Shopping Cart DB project demonstrates the development of a robust and scalable backend for an e-commerce shopping cart using Hibernate, a popular Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework. 
This project focuses on efficiently managing the database layer for storing and retrieving shopping cart data, including product information, user details, orders, and transactions.

# Key Features

- Hibernate Integration: Seamless ORM to map Java objects to relational database tables.
- Database Operations: Perform CRUD operations on entities such as Products, Users, Orders, and Cart Items.
- Entity Relationships: Demonstrates proper use of Hibernate annotations to manage relationships (e.g., One-to-Many, Many-to-Many).
- Transaction Management: Ensures consistency and reliability in database operations using Hibernateâ€™s transaction API.
- Efficient Queries: Uses HQL (Hibernate Query Language) for optimized and flexible data retrieval.
- Scalable Design: Provides a solid foundation for extending the application to larger e-commerce platforms.

# Core Entities and Relationships

* User:  Represents customers with attributes like username, email, and password.
* Product: Contains product-specific details such as name, price, description, and category.
* Cart: Tracks items added by a user, including the product and its quantity.
* Order: Captures finalized purchases, including order date, payment status, and delivery information.
* Category: Groups products into logical categories like electronics, clothing, etc.
* 
Each entity is mapped to its respective table in the database using Hibernate annotations, ensuring an intuitive and maintainable structure.

# Benefits of Using Hibernate in this Project
- Automatic Schema Generation: Hibernate can auto-generate the database schema based on entity mappings, reducing setup time.
- Lazy/Eager Loading: Efficiently manages when related entities are fetched to optimize performance.
- Database Independence: Write database-agnostic code that works across multiple relational databases without modification.
- Reduced Boilerplate Code: Simplifies database operations by eliminating the need for manual JDBC code.
- Caching: Supports first- and second-level caching to improve performance for frequently accessed data.
